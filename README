NiscuDB README

This is a fork of MongoDB 2.4.9 with some very "small" adjustments:
* --smallfiles is now on by default and causes the deafult database file to
  have a size of 256k.
* --nssize is measured in KiB rather than MiB, and defaults to 64k.
* --oplogsize is measured in KiB rather than MiB, and defaults to 64k.
* Preallocation is disabled by default.

As you can tell, these adjustments are designed to make the database disk
footprint *small*.  While MongoDB was designed to be humongous (hence the
name), its proliferation has lead to use cases where you really want something
miniscule (hence the new name).  For example, a Sandstorm.io app instance may
store a single document, but might be written using Meteor and therefore want
to use MongoDB.  The default many-megabyte database size is completely
inappropriate here and will waste the user's quota.  Niscu works better.

Obviously, Niscu will destroy performance for large databases.  But for small
ones, it hardly matters.

This code was forked from 2.4.9 because that's the version that is currently
bundled with Meteor, and I wanted to minimize chances of compatibility issues.

BUILDING
      
  See docs/building.md, also www.mongodb.org search for "Building".

RUNNING

  For command line options invoke:

    $ ./mongod --help

  To run a single server database:

    $ mkdir /data/db
    $ ./mongod
    $
    $ # The mongo javascript shell connects to localhost and test database by default:
    $ ./mongo 
    > help

DRIVERS

  Client drivers for most programming languages are available at mongodb.org.  Use the 
  shell ("mongo") for administrative tasks.

32 BIT BUILD NOTES

  MongoDB uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will
  not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit
  builds work fine with small development databases.
